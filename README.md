# Personal Blog

I'm creating a blog to stay fresh with Rails 5. Ideally this will be a good way
of updating content on my website. Using rails also makes displaying repeated
content like headers and footers consistent across all webpages without copying
and pasting code, thereby making my website on the whole more modular in the
end.
